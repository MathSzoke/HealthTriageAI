## 🧠 About the Project

**HealthTriage AI** is a simulated healthcare triage platform where multiple **AI agents** collaborate in real time to evaluate a patient’s condition.

The goal is to demonstrate how **agent orchestration** can solve real-world healthcare scenarios without handling sensitive medical data.

Each triage request goes through a complete evaluation pipeline:
- **Risk analysis** — determining urgency based on symptoms and vitals.
- **Specialist recommendation** — matching symptoms to the correct medical specialty.
- **AI advice** — generating a short and safe orientation message.
- **First-aid guide** — providing immediate, non-diagnostic care instructions.

All this happens live in the UI through a **SignalR hub**, showing how the case evolves step by step — as if multiple digital assistants were collaborating like a real medical team.

## ⚙️ Core Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|:--|:--|
| **Backend** | .NET 9 + Microsoft Agent Framework + SignalR |
| **Frontend** | React + Fluent UI + Vite |
| **AI Connectors** | OpenAI (GPT for Production) / Ollama (Local Dev) |
| **Testing** | xUnit + custom hub capture for SignalR calls |
| **Architecture** | Clean Architecture with service orchestration pattern |

## 🧩 Project Structure

```
src/
 ├─ HealthTriageAI.ApiService/      → Core API + Agent Orchestration
 │                                   - Hosts SignalR hub (/hubs/triage)
 │                                   - Coordinates 5 agents (Symptom, Risk, Specialist, Advice, FirstAid)
 │                                   - Exposes endpoints for case reporting (/api/triage/report)
 │                                   - Uses Microsoft Agent Framework for LLM orchestration
 │
 ├─ HealthTriageAI.Web/             → Frontend (React + Fluent UI)
 │                                   - Real-time dashboard for triage cases
 │                                   - Displays live case flow (symptom → risk → specialist → advice)
 │                                   - Responsive layout with filtering and search
 │                                   - Connects directly to SignalR hub
 │
 ├─ HealthTriageAI.Tests/           → Automated Tests (xUnit)
 │                                   - Unit tests for RiskAgent, SpecialistAgent, TriageCoordinator
 │                                   - Custom fake hub context for SignalR message capture
 │
 ├─ HealthTriageAI.Domain/          → Core enums and shared abstractions
 │                                   - TriageLevel, Specialist enums
 │                                   - Common DTOs (TriageInput, TriageCase)
 │
 └─ HealthTriageAI.SharedKernel/    → (Optional) Common contracts, Result<T>, Error, etc.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔄 **Real-time triage pipeline** via SignalR  
- 🧩 **Agent orchestration** using Microsoft Agent Framework  
- 💬 **GPT integration** for dynamic and contextual medical advice  
- 🧪 **Extensive testing** without external API costs (mocked advice agents)  
- 🩹 **First-aid assistant** with contextual pre-care messages  
- 💻 **Modern Fluent UI dashboard** with responsive layout and filtering  

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user submits a **triage form** (name, age, symptoms, vitals).  
2. The backend triggers a **TriageCoordinator** that orchestrates five agents:
   - **SymptomAgent** → extracts key data from text.  
   - **RiskAgent** → classifies the urgency level.  
   - **SpecialistAgent** → selects the correct specialty.  
   - **AdviceAgent** → generates safe instructions.  
   - **FirstAidAgent** → produces immediate non-diagnostic care tips.  
3. Each step emits real-time updates to the UI via **SignalR**.  
4. The frontend displays the evolution of each case visually — from report to advice.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Unit and integration tests ensure system stability without incurring AI usage costs.

| Test Area | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **RiskAgentTests** | Evaluates risk classification logic based on vitals. |
| **SpecialistAgentTests** | Maps symptom keywords to medical specialties. |
| **TriageCoordinatorTests** | Validates SignalR sequence and orchestration flow using a fake hub context. |

> AI agents are mocked in tests via `FakeAdviceAgent` and `FakeFirstAidAgent` to prevent token usage.

</p>

The interface mimics a real triage control room — each patient card updates live as the AI agents collaborate to process the case.
